# Loan Performance Data Insights

The Fannie Mae Single-Family Loan Performance Data is a large dataset released by Fannie 
Mae that includes detailed information on the performance of single-family mortgage loans. This 
data is made available to help researchers, investors, and analysts better understand mortgage 
loan performance and risk, as well as to improve modeling and analytics related to the U.S. 
housing market. 

Key Features of the Dataset 

● Loan-level Data: It contains detailed data at the individual loan level, which allows for 
in-depth analysis. 

● Credit Performance: The dataset tracks the performance of loans over time, including 
delinquency status, credit scores, loan-to-value (LTV) ratios, and other factors that 
influence loan performance. 

● Origination Data: Includes information on the characteristics of the loans when they 
were originated, such as interest rates, loan purpose, and property types. 

● Performance Data: Tracks the performance of the loans on a monthly basis, including 
payment history, default status, and modifications. 

● Modification Data: Includes details on any modifications to the original loan terms, such 
as changes in interest rates or repayment terms. 

The dataset is split into two main parts: 

1. Acquisition: This contains static information about the loans at the time they were 
originated (e.g., credit scores, loan terms).

3. Performance: This tracks the monthly performance of each loan, such as delinquency 
status, payments made, and loan modifications.
